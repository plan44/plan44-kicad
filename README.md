# plan44-kicad

## Description

This repository contains KiCad symbols and footprints as used in various [plan44.ch](https://plan44.ch/custom) projects and products.

In particular, there are footprints for Onion Omega computing modules ([Omega2](https://onion.io/omega2/), [Omega2S](https://onion.io/omega2s/)), including a special footprint using [FlexiPins](https://github.com/solderparty/flexypin) for solder-free connection of *castellated* modules such as the Omega2S on prototype boards.

Another focus is WS281x PCB connectors as used in some plan44.ch projects (e.g. [Pixelboard](https://github.com/plan44/pixelboard-hardware)).

A special part I use often is the CONFIG-PAD-2P, which is like a jumper that can be closed with solder, to configure options on a board w/o needing actual jumpers.

In addition this is just a collection of stuff I needed at some point and did not find in the standard KiCad libraries (at the time - in the meantime the KiCad library grew and some parts are now available there).
